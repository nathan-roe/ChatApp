I've just created the rooms, which will be in the url like so: 
http://localhost:3000/:userId/:roomId
Then, based off of the room id in the url, the 'messageLog' for that particular object in the rooms collection will be updated with the previous messages and the new message
* I'm not sure that the update is completely replacing the previous information (which I want) or not
* T
e messages themselves aren't being saved to the rooms collection, just the time it was created (problem with the mesArr data being sent over most likely)
* I then need to create links to the different rooms that this user can visit
